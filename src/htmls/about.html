			Hi, I am <strong>Seep Gulati</strong>. After several years of promoting companies as a <em>Public Relations professional</em>, I decided to change my path and get into something even more exciting.<br>I’m currently learning and exploring ’Coding’ at Coder Academy.</p>
			
		<h3> About Me </h3> 
		 	<p> 
			<b>Q. What light’s you up?</b> <br>
			Books which share new perspectives, interesting conversations with people on things they are passionate about and counselling people to achieve their best during their phase.
				
			<br> <br> 
				 
			<b>Q. What is the coolest thing you have accomplished? </b> <br>
			 I've struck a few cool things from my bucket list, some of them are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li> Lol, Happy dance in Coder Academy elevator.</li>
				<li> Three postgraduate diplomas in different subjects in a year, so practically doing studies for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</li>
				<li> Cheered-up a total stranger on the street.</li>
				</ul>

				<b> Q.What are you a product of?</b>  <br>
				 
				Facing fears: each year, I work on things which scare me the most and try to reach a middle ground. 

				<br><br>
				 
				 <b>Q. What’s important about you that isn’t on your resume?</b>  <br>
				 Growth mindset: I can genuinely say, whatever I have accomplished in life is due to having a mindset that our potential is infinite. We can achieve anything with hard work and sincere effort. <i>"Harder, we work, the luckier we get."</i>
