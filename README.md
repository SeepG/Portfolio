    relevant websites.

**Design process**

This website is designed as *'mobile-first'* due to a limited time frame. However, it is responsive in its behaviour. Later on, I have planned to scale it up with desktop and tablet versions

**Wireframes - Screenshots**

Wireframes were designed for Mobile and Desktop versions that gave a clear idea about the design and code flow.

#(TO ADD) - Picture Personal logo

**Personal logo**  
Purpose - I designed this personal logo to serve as my brand identity.

**Description**
This logo depicts the ideology of ‘Growth Mindset’, which was coined by Dr Carol Dweck.

I have used my initials ‘SG’ and played around with a green dot which is my little contribution to the world. I support people by introducing them to Growth Mindset-"the power of believing that they can improve their abilities and intelligence by effort and commitment".

Colour scheme is white, black and a dash of green - White and black stands for yin and yang of life, whereas green is colour of life and is associated with meanings of growth, harmony etc.

**Design and usability inspiration**
#(TO ADD) Pictures - Inspiration, usability

Grammarly is easy to use, has simple fonts and memorability.  Green and white colours are natural on the eye.

**Usability considerations**
I designed this mobile version after careful consideration of mobile-usability guidelines. I observed people in public spaces and got an understanding of how they generally hold their mobile phones.

 Therefore, the design reflects this user-behaviour research. The main content is in the centre of the screen and navigation bar is at the bottom. The tab links are in big font allowing the user to access through thumb easily.

Short Answer Q&A 

**Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)**
  
  







  
**Define and describe the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)**

Domains are names which client wants to access e.g. seepgulati.co

Domain Name Server (DNS) is a directory which keep records of all names e.g. Netlify which is seepgulati.co DNS

Web Server is a site which holds all site information (HTML pages) and hosts it e.g. Netlify is also hosting seepgulati.co

**Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)**

I find Google Maps very fascinating, because without it the world was dependent on paper maps. 
Thanks to the advancement in technology space we can now go into totally unknown area, but Google Maps will see us through.

Google Maps has made our lives a lot easier and more productive by allowing us to navigate while we walk/drive in real-time, that too in just a span of a decade.
