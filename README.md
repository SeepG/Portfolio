#(TO ADD) - Picture Personal logo

**Personal logo**

Purpose - I designed this personal logo to serve as my brand identity.

**Description**

This logo depicts the ideology of ‘Growth Mindset’, which was coined by Dr Carol Dweck.

I have used my initials ‘SG’ and played around with a green dot which is my little contribution to the world. I support people by introducing them to Growth Mindset-"the power of believing that they can improve their abilities and intelligence by effort and commitment".

Colour scheme is white, black and a dash of green - White and black stands for yin and yang of life, whereas green is colour of life and is associated with meanings of growth, harmony etc.

**Design and usability inspiration**

#Inspiration, usability

![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeepG/Portfolio/master/docs/design/inspiration-collage.png) 
Grammarly is easy to use, has simple fonts and memorability. Green and white colours are natural on the eye.

**Usability considerations**

I designed this mobile version after careful consideration of mobile-usability guidelines. I observed people in public spaces and got an understanding of how they generally hold their mobile phones.  

Therefore, the design reflects this user-behaviour research. The main content is in the centre of the screen and navigation bar is at the bottom. The tab links are in big font allowing the user to access through thumb easily.
