**Design process**

  

This website is designed as *'mobile-first'*. However, it is responsive and works in Desktop as well.

  

**Wireframes - Screenshots**



Wireframes were designed for Mobile and Desktop versions that gave a clear idea about the design and code flow.

  

#(TO ADD) - Picture Personal logo

  

**Personal logo**

Purpose - I designed this personal logo to serve as my brand identity.

  

**Description**

This logo depicts the ideology of ‘Growth Mindset’, which was coined by Dr Carol Dweck.

  

I have used my initials ‘SG’ and played around with a green dot which is my little contribution to the world. I support people by introducing them to Growth Mindset-"the power of believing that they can improve their abilities and intelligence by effort and commitment".

  

Colour scheme is white, black and a dash of green - White and black stands for yin and yang of life, whereas green is colour of life and is associated with meanings of growth, harmony etc.

**Design and usability inspiration**

#(TO ADD) Pictures - Inspiration, usability

  

Grammarly is easy to use, has simple fonts and memorability. Green and white colours are natural on the eye.

  

**Usability considerations**

I designed this mobile version after careful consideration of mobile-usability guidelines. I observed people in public spaces and got an understanding of how they generally hold their mobile phones.

  

Therefore, the design reflects this user-behaviour research. The main content is in the centre of the screen and navigation bar is at the bottom. The tab links are in big font allowing the user to access through thumb easily.

Short Answer Q&A

  

**Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today** 

  

1961: Initial concept of ARPANET, the predecessor of Internet was shared by Leonard Kleinrock.

  

1965: Two computers at MIT Lincoln Lab communicate with one another using packet-switching technology.

  

1969: ARPANET was created by J.C.R. Licklider, Kleinrock along with other innovators on August 30, 1969. This research was under the sponsorship of U.S. Defense Department Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (DARPA).

  

1973: Term ‘Internet’ was coined when University College of London (England) and Royal Radar Establishment (Norway) connected to ARPANE.

  

1974: Telnet- the first Internet Service Provider was born.

  

1982: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, as the protocol suite, emerge as the protocol for ARPANET.

  

1983: The Domain Name System (DNS) establishes the familiar .edu, .gov, .com, .mil, .org, .net, and .int system for naming websites.

  

1990: Tim Berners-Lee, CERN scientist, develops HTML.

  

1991: CERN introduces the World Wide Web to the public.

  

1998: Google search engine is born.

  

**Define and describe the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers.**

  

Domains are names which client wants to access e.g. seepgulati.co

  

Domain Name Server (DNS) is a directory which keep records of all names e.g. Netlify which is seepgulati.co DNS

  

Web Server is a site which holds all site information (HTML pages) and hosts it e.g. Netlify is also hosting seepgulati.co

  

**Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today.**

  

I find Google Maps very fascinating, because without it the world was dependent on paper maps.

Thanks to the advancement in technology space we can now go into totally unknown area, but Google Maps will see us through.

  

Google Maps has made our lives a lot easier and more productive by allowing us to navigate while we walk/drive in real-time, that too in just a span of a decade.
