Tech stack (e.g. HTML, CSS, deployment platform, etc.)

  

I worked with HTML for making the template and used CSS for styling. A little bit of JavaScript used for a click function which hides other tabs when one is active. A domain name was registered on Ventraip.com.au and configured on Netlify. Lastly, after uploading the data from Github repository, the site was deployed on Netlify.

Design process

This website is designed as 'mobile-first' due to time constraints. However, it is responsive in its behaviour. I've planned to scale it up with desktop and tablet versions.

  

Wireframes - Screenshots

Wireframes were designed for Mobile and Desktop versions that gave a clear idea about the design and code flow.

Description

This logo depicts the ideology of ‘growth mindset’, which was coined by Dr. Carol Dweck.

I have used my initials ‘SG’ and played around with a green dot which is my little contribution to the world. I support people by introducing them to "the power of believing that they can improve their abilities and intelligence by effort and commitment".

  

Color scheme is white, black and a dash of green - White and black stands for yin and yang of life, whereas green is colour of life and is associated with meanings of growth, harmony etc.

I really liked the neat structure and usablity of the website with subtle green and white color scheme.

  

Usability considerations

Considering,mobile-usablity guide, I have added nav icons at the bottom in suitable size and location which is easy to access through user thumb and main content is in the centre of screen. This design was planned after observing people in public spaces and understanding how they generally hold their mobile phones.
