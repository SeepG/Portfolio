Purpose – To serve as my brand identity.

Description

I created this logo to depict my ideology of ‘growth mindset’. Why ‘Green’ – as Green, is the colour of life and is associated with meanings of growth, harmony etc.

I have utilised my initials ‘SG’ and played around with a green dot which is my little contribution to the world, wherein I support people by introducing them to "the power of believing that you can improve your abilities and intelligence by effort and commitment".

I also uploaded it on Dribble. Here’s a link: https://dribbble.com/shots/6201255-Figma
