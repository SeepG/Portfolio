Design documentation

Design process

This website is designed as 'mobile-first' due to time constraints. However, it is responsive in its behaviour. I have planned to scale it up with desktop and tablet versions.

Wireframes - Screenshots

Wireframes were designed for Mobile and Desktop versions that gave a clear idea about the design and code flow.

Personal logo

Purpose

#(TO ADD)

Description

This logo depicts the ideology of ‘Growth Mindset’, which was coined by Dr. Carol Dweck.

I have used my initials ‘SG’ and played around with a green dot which is my little contribution to the world. I support people by introducing them to Growth Mindset-"the power of believing that they can improve their abilities and intelligence by effort and commitment".
  
Color scheme is white, black and a dash of green - White and black stands for yin and yang of life, whereas green is colour of life and is associated with meanings of growth, harmony etc.

Design and usability inspiration

Pictures - Inspiration, usablity
#(TO ADD)

Grammarly – Easy to use, simple fonts and memorablity. Subtle green and white color scheme is easy on eyes.

Usability considerations
This website designed after a careful consideration of mobile-usablity guidelines. This design was planned after observing people in public spaces and understanding how they generally hold their mobile phones.


After the careful consideration of mobile-usablity guidelines, I the main content is in centre of screen and nav bar is at the bottom. The tab links are in big font allowing user to easily access through thumb.
